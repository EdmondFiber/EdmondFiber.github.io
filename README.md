# EdmondFiber.github.io
Website? Website.

## Why does this website exist?

I want municipal fiber. Other people probably do as well.

## How do I contribute to this website?

Fork the repo, do stuff. Here's the flowchart:

```
origin/master    |==============================o===
origin/develop   |======\==================o===/====
origin/addition  |       \         o===o==/
yourrepo/develop |        o=o==o==/
```

`origin/master` is the production branch.
`origin/develop` is the main development branch.
`yourrepo/develop` is your branch.

After you have started work on a feature locally, open a pull request to merge it into `origin/develop`. You will be added to the organization, and your remote branch (`yourrepo/develop`) will be merged into origin on a new branch (`origin/addition`). Finally, after it is complete, open another PR to merge into develop.

Merges to master happen on regular intervals.
